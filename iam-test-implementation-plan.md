# IAM Module Test Implementation Plan

## Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented tests for the first two phases of the plan and made significant progress on Phase 4 (Controllers). The current test coverage is as follows:

### Domain Layer
- **IamRole Enum**: 100% coverage
- **Domain Exceptions**: 100% coverage
- **Domain Events**: 100% coverage
- **User Entity**: 97% coverage (283 of 290 instructions)

### Application Use Cases
- **GetAllUsersUseCase**: 100% coverage
- **GetUserByCpfUseCase**: 100% coverage
- **DeleteUserUseCase**: 100% coverage
- **RegisterUserUseCase**: 100% coverage
- **AuthenticateUserUseCase**: 96% coverage (10 of 314 instructions missed)
- **UpdateUserUseCase**: 100% coverage

### Controllers (Phase 4)
- **UserMgmtController**: 100% coverage
- **UserAuthController**: 100% coverage
- **IamGlobalExceptionHandler**: 100% coverage
- **UserDTOMapper**: 99% coverage (3 of 421 instructions missed)

### Overall Coverage
- **Domain Layer**: 99% coverage
- **Application Layer**: 96% coverage
- **Controller Layer**: 99% coverage
- **Project Overall**: 75% coverage (up from 63%)

## Test Execution Notes

When running tests with `mvn clean test jacoco:report`, all tests are executed correctly, including those for the product and infrastructure modules. The JaCoCo report now shows much better coverage for these modules:

- Product domain entity: 100% coverage
- Product domain events: 100% coverage
- Product domain exceptions: 100% coverage
- Product infrastructure controllers: 99% coverage
- Product infrastructure messaging: 91-100% coverage
- Infrastructure messaging SQS model: 100% coverage
- IAM controllers: 99% coverage (new)
- IAM DTOs and mappers: 99% coverage (new)

The overall project coverage is now at 75% (up from 63% in the previous report), which is a significant improvement. The IAM controller tests have been successfully implemented with comprehensive test cases covering all endpoints and error scenarios.

## Test Quality Improvement Plan

To address the warnings and exceptions in test logs, we'll implement the following improvements:

### 1. Mockito Warning Resolution

For "unnecessary stubbing" warnings:
- Only stub methods that will actually be called in the test
- Use `lenient()` for stubs that may or may not be called depending on test path
- Refactor tests to avoid setting up unused mocks
- Add `@MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT)` only when necessary

Example:
```java
// Instead of this:
when(userGateway.findByCpf(cpf)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
when(userGateway.findByEmail(email)).thenReturn(Optional.empty()); // Unnecessary if test fails at first check

// Do this:
when(userGateway.findByCpf(cpf)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
// Only add the second stub if the test will reach that point
```

### 2. Improved Exception Testing

For tests that expect exceptions:
- Use JUnit 5's assertThrows with specific exception types
- Verify exception message content when relevant
- Avoid catching exceptions in test methods unless necessary for verification
- Test both success and failure paths explicitly

Example:
```java
@Test
void shouldThrowExceptionWhenUserDoesNotExist() {
    // Given
    String cpf = "nonexistent";
    when(userGateway.findByCpf(cpf)).thenReturn(Optional.empty());
    
    // When/Then
    UserNotFoundException exception = assertThrows(
        UserNotFoundException.class,
        () -> getUserByCpfUseCase.getUserByCpf(cpf)
    );
    
    // Additional verification
    assertEquals("User not found with CPF: " + cpf, exception.getMessage());
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Test Structure

Improve test organization and readability:
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (Given-When-Then) pattern consistently
- Use descriptive test method names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using nested classes
- Use setup methods for common test fixtures

Example:
```java
@Nested
class WhenUserExists {
    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        // Common setup for all tests in this context
    }
    
    @Test
    void shouldReturnUserWhenFoundByCpf() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}

@Nested
class WhenUserDoesNotExist {
    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        // Different setup for this context
    }
    
    @Test
    void shouldThrowExceptionWhenUserNotFound() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### 4. Improved Mock Verification

Enhance mock verification to ensure correct interactions:
- Verify exact number of method calls
- Use ArgumentCaptor to verify complex arguments
- Verify order of interactions when relevant
- Verify no unexpected interactions occurred

Example:
```java
@Test
void shouldPublishEventAfterUserCreation() {
    // Test setup and execution
    
    // Verification
    ArgumentCaptor<UserCreatedEvent> eventCaptor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(UserCreatedEvent.class);
    verify(eventPublisher).publish(eventCaptor.capture());
    
    UserCreatedEvent capturedEvent = eventCaptor.getValue();
    assertEquals(userId, capturedEvent.getUserId());
    assertEquals(email, capturedEvent.getUserEmail());
}
```

### 5. Better Test Isolation

Ensure tests are properly isolated:
- Reset shared resources between tests
- Use @BeforeEach and @AfterEach for setup/teardown
- Consider using separate test profiles
- Avoid static state that persists between tests

Example:
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class SomeTest {
    @Mock
    private UserGateway userGateway;
    
    private UserService userService;
    
    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        userService = new UserService(userGateway);
        // Additional setup
    }
    
    @AfterEach
    void tearDown() {
        // Clean up any resources
    }
}
```

### 6. Improved Integration Testing

For tests involving external systems:
- Use TestContainers for database and AWS service testing
- Use WireMock for HTTP service mocking
- Create appropriate test profiles
- Implement proper cleanup after tests

Example:
```java
@Testcontainers
class MongoRepositoryTest {
    @Container
    static MongoDBContainer mongoDBContainer = new MongoDBContainer("mongo:4.4.6");
    
    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void setProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
        registry.add("spring.data.mongodb.uri", mongoDBContainer::getReplicaSetUrl);
    }
    
    // Test methods
}
```

## Revised Approach

Based on the JaCoCo coverage report and the need for improved test quality, we'll implement tests with the following key principles:

1. **Start with simpler components** to build momentum and establish testing patterns
2. **Achieve 80% coverage for each file** before moving to the next component
3. **Progress from simpler to more complex components** to establish testing patterns that can be reused
4. **Focus on test quality** not just coverage metrics
5. **Improve testability** of the code through better design

## Best Practices

1. **Test Naming Convention:**
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested
   - Follow the pattern: `should[ExpectedBehavior]When[StateUnderTest]`

2. **Test Organization:**
   - Group tests by functionality
   - Use nested classes for related test scenarios

3. **Test Independence:**
   - Ensure tests can run in any order
   - Clean up test data after each test

4. **Test Coverage Quality:**
   - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document complex test setups
   - Explain the purpose of test fixtures and utilities

## Special Considerations

   - Test error logging and monitoring
   - Ensure sensitive information is not leaked in error messages

3. **Clean Architecture Boundaries:**
   - Ensure tests respect the clean architecture boundaries
   - Test adapters at the boundaries between layers
   - Verify that dependencies flow inward
   - Test that domain rules are not violated

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Include performance tests for token generation/validation
   - Test caching mechanisms
   - Verify database query performance
   - Test concurrent authentication requests

5. **Integration Points:**
   - Test integration with external systems
   - Verify correct behavior when external systems fail
   - Test retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
   - Validate data consistency across system boundaries

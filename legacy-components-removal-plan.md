### In Progress
- üîÑ Preparing for medium-impact component removal

### Pending
- ‚è≥ Medium and high-impact component removal

## Components with Fewest Dependencies (Phase 1) - COMPLETED

These components have been successfully moved to the junkyard folder:

1. **IamServiceImpl.java** ‚úÖ
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: IamService interface
   - Used by: None (appears to be unused)
   - Removal impact: Low - No direct usage identified
   - **Status**: Moved to junkyard

2. **IamService.java** ‚úÖ
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: None
   - Used by: IamServiceImpl
   - Removal impact: Low - No direct usage in controllers or other services
   - **Status**: Moved to junkyard

3. **ApplicationConfiguration.java** ‚úÖ
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: None
   - Used by: Spring context
   - Removal impact: Low - Can be replaced by new configuration classes
   - **Status**: Moved to junkyard

4. **OpenApiConfig.java** ‚úÖ
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: None
   - Used by: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Removal impact: Low - Can be replaced by a new configuration in the infrastructure layer
   - **Status**: Moved to junkyard

5. **JwtAuthenticationFilter.java** ‚úÖ
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: JwtService, UserDetailsService
   - Used by: SecurityConfiguration
   - Removal impact: Medium - Needs to be fully replaced by IamJwtAuthenticationFilter
   - **Status**: Created adapter that delegates to IamJwtAuthenticationFilter

## Components with Medium Dependencies (Phase 2) - NEXT STEPS

These components have more dependencies but can be removed next. Detailed implementation steps are provided:

1. **SecurityConfiguration.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: JwtAuthenticationFilter
   - Used by: Spring Security context
   - Removal impact: Medium - Needs to be fully replaced by IamSecurityConfig
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. Create a new adapter class `SecurityConfigurationAdapter` that extends the original `SecurityConfiguration`
     2. Override the `securityFilterChain` method to delegate to `IamSecurityConfig`
     3. Add `@Primary` annotation to the new adapter to ensure it's used by Spring
     4. Mark the original `SecurityConfiguration` as `@Deprecated`
     5. Update any direct references to use the new configuration

2. **JwtService.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: None (but delegates to new JwtService)
   - Used by: AuthenticationController, UserController
   - Removal impact: Medium - Controllers need to be updated to use the new JwtService
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. Ensure the legacy JwtService properly delegates all methods to the new implementation
     2. Add `@Qualifier("legacyJwtService")` to the legacy service
     3. Add `@Qualifier("jwtService")` to the new service
     4. Update controllers to inject the new service using the qualifier
     5. Once all references are updated, mark the legacy service as `@Deprecated`

3. **UserDetailsEntity.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.domain`
   - Dependencies: None
   - Used by: AuthenticationService, UserService
   - Removal impact: Medium - Services need to be updated to use the new User entity
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. Create an adapter class that converts between `UserDetailsEntity` and the new `User` entity
     2. Update the `AuthenticationService` and `UserService` to use the adapter
     3. Gradually refactor code to use the new `User` entity directly
     4. Add unit tests to verify the adapter works correctly
     5. Mark `UserDetailsEntity` as `@Deprecated`

4. **UserEntity.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.domain`
   - Dependencies: None
   - Used by: IamRepository, UserRepository, AuthenticationService, UserService
   - Removal impact: Medium - Services and repositories need to be updated to use the new User entity
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     1. Create an adapter class that converts between `UserEntity` and the new `User` entity
     2. Update repositories to use the adapter when returning results
     3. Update services to use the adapter when receiving entities
     4. Add unit tests to verify the adapter works correctly
     5. Mark `UserEntity` as `@Deprecated`

## Components with High Dependencies (Phase 3)

These components have the most dependencies and should be removed last:

1. **IamRepository.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.infrastructure`
   - Dependencies: UserEntity
   - Used by: AuthenticationService, UserService
   - Removal impact: High - Services need to be updated to use the new UserRepository

2. **UserRepository.java** (legacy)
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.infrastructure`
   - Dependencies: UserEntity
   - Used by: UserService
   - Removal impact: High - UserService needs to be updated to use the new UserRepository

3. **AuthenticationService.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: IamRepository, PasswordEncoder, AuthenticationManager
   - Used by: AuthenticationController, UserController
   - Removal impact: High - Controllers need to be updated to use the new use cases

4. **UserService.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.application`
   - Dependencies: IamRepository, UserRepository
   - Used by: AuthenticationController, UserController
   - Removal impact: High - Controllers need to be updated to use the new use cases

5. **AuthenticationController.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.web`
   - Dependencies: JwtService, AuthenticationService, UserService
   - Used by: API clients
   - Removal impact: High - API clients need to migrate to the new endpoints

6. **UserController.java**
   - Located in: `com.snackbar.iam.web`
   - Dependencies: JwtService, AuthenticationService, UserService
   - Used by: API clients
   - Removal impact: High - API clients need to migrate to the new endpoints

## Removal Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Remove Low-Impact Components** ‚úÖ
   - Move IamServiceImpl.java to junkyard folder ‚úÖ
   - Move IamService.java to junkyard folder ‚úÖ
   - Move ApplicationConfiguration.java to junkyard folder ‚úÖ
   - Move OpenApiConfig.java to junkyard folder ‚úÖ
   - Create adapter for JwtAuthenticationFilter to use IamJwtAuthenticationFilter ‚úÖ

2. **Phase 2: Remove Medium-Impact Components**
   - Create adapter for SecurityConfiguration to use IamSecurityConfig
   - Update controllers to use new JwtService directly
   - Create adapters for UserDetailsEntity to User entity
   - Create adapters for UserEntity to User entity

3. **Phase 3: Remove High-Impact Components**
   - Create adapters for IamRepository to use new UserRepository
   - Create adapters for legacy UserRepository to use new UserRepository
   - Implement new use cases to replace AuthenticationService and UserService
   - Create redirects from old API endpoints to new endpoints

4. **Phase 4: Final Cleanup**
   - Remove all redirects and adapters
   - Remove all legacy components
   - Update documentation

## Testing Strategy

Before removing each component:
1. Create unit tests for the replacement component
2. Create integration tests that verify the functionality
3. Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions

After removing each component:
1. Run all tests again to verify functionality
2. Manually test affected features
3. Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Lessons Learned from Phase 1

1. **Adapter Pattern Works Well**: The adapter pattern allowed us to maintain backward compatibility while transitioning to new implementations.
2. **Integration Testing is Critical**: Running integration tests after each component removal helped verify that the system still works correctly.
3. **Dependency Management**: Understanding the dependencies between components is crucial for a successful migration.
4. **Incremental Approach**: Moving components one by one and testing after each change proved to be a safe approach.
